            <p><h3>Contents of the database</h3></p>
            <p>The database for the Louvre’s collections consists of entries for more than 500,000 works of art that are part of the national collections and registered in the inventories of the museum’s nine curatorial departments (Near Eastern Antiquities; Egyptian Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities; Byzantine and Eastern Christian Art; Islamic Art; Paintings; Medieval, Renaissance and Modern Sculpture; Prints and Drawings; Medieval, Renaissance and Modern Decorative Arts), those of the History of the Louvre department, or the inventories of the Musée National Eugène-Delacroix, administratively attached to the Louvre since 2004.</p>
            <p><h3>Photographs</h3></p>
            <p>The majority of the artwork entries include photographs taken during shoots organised by the Musée du Louvre – with the Réunion des Musées Nationaux-Grand Palais and photographers contracted by the Louvre – to ensure the collections are fully documented with recent images of professional quality. However, some of the artwork entries do include non-professional photographs. There are two main reasons for this: in most cases, the works in question are on loan in other institutions in France or abroad and the Louvre is as such unable to organise a professional shoot; in other instances, the photographs have been taken by Louvre staff members while they were working on the artwork (conservation treatment, inventory project, etc.) and are provided on a temporary basis pending a scheduled professional shoot. The overarching idea is that in order to allow users to identify the artworks, it is better to provide at least one photograph, even if of poorer quality, than none at all. Having visual elements that allow for the proper identification of artworks is not only important for the general public, but also for the efforts being made to fight against the illicit trafficking of cultural property. </p>
