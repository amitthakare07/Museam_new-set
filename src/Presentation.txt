Effective PII masking can reduce breach damage make audits easier and improve company reputation 

* Slide 6: Limitations of Existing Systems

now lets expands on the problems mentioned earlier by detailing the specific limitations of current PII masking systems.

1.Manual & Error-Prone Processes: Current methods rely on manual review or simple searches, which often miss PII in large    datasets or unstructured documents like PDFs.

2.Limited Detection Capabilities: Many systems are restricted to fixed data formats and cannot identify context-based PII hidden within text.

3.Lack of Automation & Customization: Older systems are inefficient because they lack automation, multi-format support, and customizable masking options.

4.Increased Risk Exposure: These limitations lead to a higher risk of data breaches, non-compliance with laws, and a significant loss of customer trust.

*Slide 11: System Module
1.Input Handling Module
To handle different types of input.
It can take text files, PDFs, or direct manual text input.
Converts them into a format the system can read.

* Slide 14: Implementation

Let's dive deeper into the two different interfaces used.

1.React.js Frontend: A modern, responsive user interface for the main web application. Its features include file/text upload, flexible masking method selection, real-time preview, and API calls to the backend. It's built with React.js, Tailwind CSS/Material UI, and Fetch API/Axios.

2.Streamlit Interface: An internal interface for testing and quick demonstrations. Its features include intuitive sidebar controls, instant result display, and easy debugging. It's built with Streamlit and libraries like PyPDF2/PyMuPDF for file reading.


* Slide 18: Key Differentiators
Our smart PII Masking solution delivers unique capabilities and strong performance to meet key privacy and operational needs.    

1.High Precision & Recall: Achieves exceptional accuracy with less than 1% false positives and false negatives.

2. Multi-language & Custom Entity Support: Can handle diverse languages and allows for the definition of custom PII entities.


3. Real-time Streaming Throughput: Can process large volumes of data at high speeds.

4. In-flight & At-rest Detection: Secures PII whether it's in transit or stored.

5. Explainable Detections & Audit Trail: Provides transparency into how PII is identified and masked, along with a detailed            
   audit trail.

6. Seamless Cloud & On-prem Deployment: Offers flexible deployment options for cloud or on-premise environments.
